# epinowcast 0.0.6

* Fully vectorise the likelihood by flattening observations and pre-specify expected observations into a vector before calculating the log-likelihood (see [#40](https://github.com/epiforecasts/epinowcast/pull/40) by [@seabbs](https://github.com/seabbs)).
* Add profiling switch to model compilation, allowing to toggle profiling (https://mc-stan.org/cmdstanr/articles/profiling.html) on/off in the same model (see [#41](https://github.com/epiforecasts/epinowcast/pull/41) by [@adrian-lison](https://github.com/adrian-lison)).
* Adds vectorisation of zero truncated normal distributions (see [#38](https://github.com/epiforecasts/epinowcast/pull/38) by [@seabbs](https://github.com/seabbs))

# epinowcast 0.0.5

* Convert retrospective data date fields to class of `IDate` when utilising `enw_retrospective_data` to solve esoteric error.
* Added full argument name for `include_paths` to avoid console chatter
* Adds a `stanc_options` argument to `enw_model()` and specifies a new default of `list("01")` which enables simple pre-compilation optimisations. See [here](https://blog.mc-stan.org/2022/02/15/release-of-cmdstan-2-29/) of these optimisatiosn for details.
* Remove `inv_logit` and `logit` as may instead use base R `plogit` and `qlogit`.

# epinowcast 0.0.4

* Add support for extracting and summarising posterior nowcast samples
* Package spell check
* Update read me quick start to use 40 days of delay vs 30
* Add a section to the read me quick start showing an example of handling nowcast samples.
* Add support for passing custom models and included files to `enw_model()`.
* Fix a bug where `enw_summarise_samples()` returned duplicate samples.
* Add support for passing holidays as a variable and then adjusting by converting the holiday day into a custom day of the week (by default Sunday but this is set by the user).
* Added support for scoring on both the natural and log scale. This represents absolute and relative scoring respectively.

# epinowcast 0.0.3

* Add support for passing in priors
* Add case study vignette
* Add model definition and implementation details.
* Add support for out of sample scoring (using `scoringutils`).

# epinowcast 0.0.2

* Initial version of the package with broadly working functionality and first draft vignettes.

# epinowcast 0.0.1

* Initial package version with development code
