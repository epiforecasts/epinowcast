This package contains tools to enable flexible and efficient nowcasting
of right censored epidemiological counts using a semi-mechanistic method
with adjustment available for both day of reference and day of report
effects.

## Installation

### Installing the package

Install the unstable development from GitHub using the following,

``` r
remotes::install_github("seabbs/epinowcast", dependencies = TRUE)
```

### Installing CmdStan

If you don’t already have CmdStan installed then, in addition to
installing `epinowcast`, it is also necessary to install CmdStan using
CmdStanR’s `install_cmdstan()` function to enable model fitting in
`epinowcast`. A suitable C++ toolchain is also required. Instructions
are provided in the [*Getting started with
CmdStanR*](https://mc-stan.org/cmdstanr/articles/cmdstanr.html)
vignette. See the [CmdStanR
documentation](https://mc-stan.org/cmdstanr/) for further details and
support.

``` r
cmdstanr::install_cmdstan()
```
